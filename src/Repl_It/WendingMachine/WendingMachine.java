    /**
     * In this assignment we will build a simple Vending machine for drinks.
     *
     * There are many types of Vending Machines: for drinks, snacks, electronics, gold etc.
     *
     * So we decided to create parent abstract class  VendingMachines for all specific vending machines to extend.
     *
     * Abstract class VendingMachine contains abstract methods that any specific sub type of vending machines will extend and provide implementation.
     *
     * In this assignment we will implement DrinkVendingMachine that is based on Abstract class VendingMachine.
     *
     * DrinkVendingMachine is responsible to extend VendingMachine and provide functionality/implementation for each abstract method.
     *
     * Please go over method  and follow the instructions on top of each method.
